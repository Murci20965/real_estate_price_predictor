## üìñ Overview

This project is a complete, end-to-end MLOps system designed to predict housing prices in Ames, Iowa. It follows a modern software engineering and machine learning workflow, encompassing everything from data exploration and model training to API development, containerization with Docker, and automated deployment to the AWS cloud.

The core of the project is a **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)** model, a high-performance algorithm renowned for its accuracy on tabular data.

---

## üìä Model Performance

The model was evaluated on an unseen test set (20% of the original data). The performance metrics indicate a highly accurate and reliable model.

-   **R-squared (R¬≤)**: **0.9037**
    -   This means the model can explain approximately **90.4%** of the variance in the house sale prices.
-   **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: **0.1341**
    -   This is the average prediction error on the log-transformed sale prices.

| Metric                | Score    | Description                         |
| :-------------------- | :------- | :---------------------------------- |
| **R-squared (R¬≤)** | `0.9037` | Explains 90.4% of price variance.   |
| **RMSE (on log scale)** | `0.1341` | Low average prediction error.       |

## üöÄ CI/CD Automation

This project is configured with a complete CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. On every push to the `main` branch, the following automated workflow is triggered:
1.  **Run Tests**: The `pytest` suite is executed to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.
2.  **Build & Push**: A new Docker image is built and pushed to a private Amazon ECR repository.
3.  **Deploy**: The new image is automatically deployed to the AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment, updating the live application.
